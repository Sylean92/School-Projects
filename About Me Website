	<h1> About Me . . .</h1>

	<p>
	In this section provided will be a short introduction about my life. To begin with,
	it is best to start from the beginning.<br><br>

	The first fun fact I enjoy sharing is where I was born. <br>
	On <strong><font color = "black">October 6, 1992</strong></font>
	I was born in an airforce base called <strong>Fairbanks</strong>.
	This was due to the fact that my father was in the military, which station
	our family locally in Alaska. Second born child, beside my brother Matthew,
	we began our lives as urbanized eskimos.
	</p>

	<p>
	A few years later we moved to New Berlin, Wisconsin living in what we called the "little blue house".
	At the age of 6, my parents decided to split which split my brother and I apart.
	I grew up for most of the rest of my life moving from place to place.
	I spent most my young years living in Tonganoxie, Kansas until Sophmore year of high school.
	By sophmore year I lived in a art high school in De Soto, Kansas. I loved the art appreciation there
	and was able to pursue my art passion. I graducated from a national art college credited class
	with a high score. I won also a few ribbons for my sculptures and art work as well.
	With this passion for art, I graduated high school in 2011 to pursue Game Art major
	near my father and brother in Texas.
	</p>

	<p>
	After a few semesters and creating a model for a senior class before I even hit my
	modeling classes, I realized that having the time frames and pressure to create art
	wasn't something I wanted to pursue. I loved art and wanted to create on my own time.
	I enjoyed the technical aspects, so I decided to change to a more technical degree.
	I graduated with a Tech Support Certificate right before our family decided to move
	back to Wisconsin because my Step Mom got a new job. So here I am attending UWW for
	a Computer Science Bachelor's Degree with a minor of Web Development. I love programming
	with HTML and CSS. I hope to gain more experience in designing web sites, with the hope
	of a future career in Web Development.
	</p>

	<p>
	After a year of living in Wisconsin I decided to move out of my partents house to do what
	people call "leaving the nest". With that being said, I decided to move out an hour away to
	live near downtown Milwaukee, WI. I currently support myself on my own in my own apartment while
	continuing to be a commuter to UWW.

			<br><br><h2>Concealment</h2>
			<p>I am very proud of this drawing. I feel I gave it a lot of
			depth and texture while there is a lot of variance in texture
			in the subject matter. I really liked how the wings turned out
			and the look of the branches.</td>
			</p><br><br><br>
			<h2> Jungle Gym Fun</h2>
			<p> This drawing was part of a larger image taken of both my older brother,
			me and my little brother. This image is a close up of my little brother,
			Donovan, who is hanging by his arms on our jungle gym.
			</p>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<h2> Concentration </h2>
			<p> This drawing happened while I was preparing for pieces of work for
			my college AP art class in High School. An old friend was spending the day
			with me and the idea came to mind of taking a quick shot close up of her.
			</p>
			<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<h2> Movement </h2>
			<p> This is a pencil work that I completed during my AP art course in high
			school. This drawing I really liked because of all the fur/hair movement.
			I wanted the movement to bring more "movement" versus realism to the piece.
			My favorite part about this art work is the eye and cheak of the lion. It is
			the most realistic part of the piece.
			</p><br><br><br><br><br>
			<h2> Embracing the Heat </h2>
			<p> After I graduated high school I began to engage into more technical artwork.
			This drawing was made a few years later after high school. In other words, this is
			the most recent piece of work after the rest few displayed below. This piece of work
			means a lot because it was a drawing I made to give to my current boyfriend to this date.
			</p><br><br><br><br>
			<h2> Eluna </h2>
			<p> Inspired by the desire to re-create a Sci-Fi scene in space, I wanted to make a space
			dragon. Dragon's are my favorite creature to draw and I love space so it seemed like the
			most perfect scene. This was one of my first complete digital drawings. My most favorite
			part of this drawing is his face.
			</p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
			<h2> Spring - Pipistrellus Draco </h2>
			<p> Final digital drawing that I felt was the most detailed that I have finished. I loved how
			the background made it feel like the spring dragon was inside a tree. I always enjoy the head
			of the dragons I draw more than anything because the details are always more defined. The bodies
			always tend to lack some form; however, I still enjoy the style I chose.

		<h1> Hobbies & Interest </h1>
		<p> I have always been a sucker for technology. Ever since I was a little kid I was
		playing on consoles, hand-held devices, ejoyed the entertainment through televisions and
		so forth. I haven't really enjoyed the outside given I had a few allergies to nature. Growing
		up as a kid allergic to grass kind of limits you to the common adolescent enjoyments. I found out
		the hard way when I was jumping on hay barrels with one of my childhood friends, and going home
		beat read from head to toe. </p>
		<p> Therefore, most of my hobbies involve technology. I love to play video games. My interest range
		from the console classics of Spyro, Mario, Pac Man, Twisted Metal, Rayman and Soul Calibur to more recent game
		versions like Final Fantasy, COD, Fallout 3, Dragon Age, Aion, Guild Wars and League of Legends. I have literally
		played all console systems and hand-held devices.</p>
		<p>Aside of gaming, I love to draw as seen on another page. I have a passion for both pencil work, sculptures and
		digital art. Digital art is the most recent new material form I have learned. I really have grown attached to digital
		drawing. I have won a few ribbons for my pencil work, I ribbon for my famous large buddah fountain sculpture and so forth.
		</p>
		<p> I am also a major movie fan. I love collecting movies as a hobby and hope to own a wall full of movies. I would have to say
		fantasy is my all time favorite genre. Aside fantasy my next favorite genres are sci-fi, animation and comedy. I also enjoy watching
		stand up comedies on tv during my free time or animated comedy cartoons with harsh comedy like Family Guy. My favorite animated films
		are Megamind, Kung Fu Panda and so forth. For the other genres, if I were to list my favorites then the list may never end.
		</p>
		<p> Currently, my interest is also driven towards web development as well. I have begun to practice the coding on my own time,
		and trying to learn all aspects about web design as well.</p>
		<p> Last but not least, I also hope to create phone app games along side my future career job. My initial major involved
		Game Art; therefore, I felt just because I moved on to a different major didn't mean I should give up. I want to be able to create
		artwork and harness my skills in programming to create art and games on my own time. This may require me to work a lot of hours but
		I feel it will be worth it in the long run!</p>

		<h1> Overview </h1><br><br><br>
		<p> Currently covered two courses over C++ which allowed me to be engaged with my
		my first real experience with a high level language. C++ is both intuitive and
		complicated coding style. A struggle to fully understand, I am hoping to strengthen
		my skills more so that I have a better structure understanding of the language.
		</p><br><br><br><br><br><br>
		<p> PowerShell contains a command-line shell and scritping language framework. This is
		most helpful when looking at computer and user information. I have used this language only
		in a corporate situation. I have developed and used various different scripts that looked at:
			- Duplicating documents and returning copies to help with documenting corporate documents
			- Scripts that looked up disabled users and their connection to groups
			- Scripts that looked up user IDs and their corresponding direct reports
			- Scripts that looked up ownership of users or groups
			- Scripts that looked up last logon times
			- Scripts that looked up Descriptions, information, specificed Special OU groups, members and so forth
		</p><br>
		<p> Began learning these two types of languages a few months prior to my Spring Semester at UWW. I have a
		strong destire and passion for website construction. I began learning these languages on my own so that I could
		begin to develop my portfolio and practice more. This language is both intertaining and artistically appealing.
		I hope to learn more of the graphic design aspect soon so that I can become a better Web Developer and Designer.
